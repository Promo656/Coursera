                <p class="p1">The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial
                    nightshade Solanum tuberosum. In many contexts, potato refers
                    to the edible tuber, but it can also refer to the plant itself.
                    Common or slang terms include tater, tattie and spud. Potatoes were
                    introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century.</p>

                <p class="p1">The onion (Allium cepa L., from Latin cepa "onion"), also known as
                    the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable
                    that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Its
                    close relatives include the garlic, leek, chive, and Chinese onion.</p>

                <p class="p1">The tomato is the edible, often red, berry of the nightshade Solanum
                    lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant. The species originated
                    in western South America. The Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the
                    Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived.</p>
